# Developer Guide

Website is deployed in Kubernetes cluster. A deployment contains the following
containers:

- website: A Flask app with static files complied by Webpack.
- mixer: The Data Commons API server.
- esp: Google Extensive Service Proxy used for gRPC to Json transcoding.

[Mixer](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/mixer) is a submodule of this Git
repo. The exact commit of the submodule is deployed together with the website so
it may not be the same API version as `api.datacommons.org`. Make sure to update
and track the mixer change for a new deployment:

```bash
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```

## Prerequisites

- Contact Data Commons team to get dev maps api key.

- Contact Data Commons team to get permission for BigTable and BigQuery
  permission.

- Get GCP authentication

  ```bash
  gcloud auth application-default login
  ```

- Initialize the mixer submodule

  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

- Install the following tools:

  - [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - [`Minikube`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
  - [`Skaffold`](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/)
  - [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
  - [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
  - [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - [`kustomize`](https://kustomize.io/)

## Run Tests

### Install web browser and webdriver

Before running the tests, install the browser and webdriver. Here we recommend
you use Google Chrome browser and ChromeDriver.

- Chrome browser can be downloaded [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

- ChromeDriver can be downloaded
  [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads/version-selection), or you
  can download it using package manager directly:

  ```bash
  npm install chromedriver
  ```

If using Linux system, you can run the following commands to download Chrome
browser and ChromeDriver, this will also include the path setup:

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb; sudo apt-get -fy install
CHROMEDRIVERV=$(curl https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/LATEST_RELEASE)
wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/${CHROMEDRIVERV}/chromedriver_linux64.zip
unset CHROMEDRIVERV
unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
sudo mv chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver
sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/chromedriver
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/chromedriver
```

Note: Make sure that your ChromeDriver version is compatible with your local
Google Chrome version. You can change view the lastet ChromeDriver version
[here](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/LATEST_RELEASE). Also make
sure PATH is updated with ChromeDriver location.

### Run all tests

```bash
./run_test.sh -a
```

### Update React test snapshots

```bash
cd static
npm test testfilename -- -u
```

## Develop with Flask (simple/lite)

This way the website talks to the [autopush Mixer](autopush.api.datacommons.org)

Note: the autopushed mixer can deviate from the mixer submodule and may not be
fully compatible with website.

### Package javascript and static assets

```bash
./run_npm.sh
```

This will watch static files change and re-build on code edit.

### Start the Flask Server

Start the flask webserver locally at localhost:8080

```bash
./run_server.sh
```

Run website under StatVarObs mode:

```bash
./run_server.sh svobs
```

If you don't have DataCommons GCP permissions, run

```bash
./run_server.sh lite
```

This will bring up local website without place search functionality.

## Develop with local Kubernetes

This is an alternative way to bring up website stack locally and this is close
to how the production server is deployed in GKE.

Local Kubernetes cluster has the exact same settings and configurations as the
production deployment. This is recommended way for development.

### Start website in Minikube

```bash
minikube start --memory=6G
minikube addons enable gcp-auth
eval $(minikube docker-env)
kubectl config use-context minikube
skaffold dev --port-forward -n website
```

This exposes the local website at `localhost:8080`.

### Hot reload

All the code change is synced to the containers through "File Sync" of Skaffold.

Run the following command to get the javascript code recompiled when changed:

```bash
./run_npm.sh
```

Python code change will trigger a restart of the Flask server automatically.

### Monitoring the containers

Run `minikube dashboard` in a separate terminal to start the dashboard, which is
useful for monitoring and controlling the containers.

## Other Developing Tips

### GKE config

The GKE configuration is stored [here](deploy/gke/prod.yaml).

### placeid2dcid.json

This file is stored in GCS bucket. The bucket is set in the config files
[autopush](deploy/gke/autopush.yaml), [staging](deploy/gke/staging.yaml) and
[prod](deploy/gke/prod.yaml).

### Redis memcache

[Redis
memcache](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/memorystore/redis/instances?project=datcom-website-prod)
is used for production deployment. Each cluster has a Redis instance located in
the same region.

### Adding new charts

- Update server/chart_config.json with the new chart. Manually restart the flask
  or minikube instance to load the config.

- If required, update localization related files. See localization.md for
  further instructions:

  - If a new stat var is introduced, update
    static/js/i18n/strings/en/stat*var*[labels|titles].json.

  - If a new unit is required, update static/js/i18n/i18n.tsx as well as
    static/js/i18n/strings/en/units.json with display names and labels for the
    unit.
