#. Description of the Data Commons project. "open knowledge repository": It's a knowledge repository, or knowledge graph (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph). It's also open: free to use, community maintained and open sourced. "combines data": Multiple datasets are combined into a single knowledge graph "mapped common entities": Data about the same entity across datasets are mapped to a single common entity. E.g. Data about "California" across the US Census and World Bank are combined under the same "California" entity (or node). Data joining (or merging), is the work that is required to analyze data across multiple datasets (e.g. https://www.displayr.com/what-is-data-merging/). In summary, Data Commons is an open sourced, community project that includes data from across many data sets into a single knowledge graph, where data about the same entity is already combined for easy exploration and analysis.
