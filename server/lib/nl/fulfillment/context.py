# Computes a list of place lists, where each inner list is a candidate for place
# comparison.  The outer list is ordered from most prefered candidates to least.
#
# The logic for determining a single place comparison candidate is as follows:
# 1. If an utterance has multiple places, then that is a candidate list.
# 2. If an utterance has a single place, then we walk up prior utterances until
#    we find an utterance with at least one place.  The candidate list is
#    the former single place plus the latter from prior utterance.
#
# For example, suppose the query sequence is as follows:
#   [tell me about san jose] -> [how is auto theft in fremont] -> [compare with palo alto]
#
# In this case, the ordered candidates will be:
#   [[palo alto, fremont], [palo alto, san jose], [fremont, san jose]]
#
# If instead of the last query, we had:
#  [compare among palo alto, sunnyvale and san jose]
# Then, the ordered candidates will be:
#  [[palo alto, sunnyvale, san jose], [fremont, san jose]]
