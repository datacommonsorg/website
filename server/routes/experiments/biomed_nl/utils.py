ENTITY_RANK_PROMPT = '''We are going to traverse a knowledge graph to answer the query: {QUERY}

In order to respond to this query, we will be traversing a knowledge graph.
We are trying to determine which of the following would be the most helpful starting place to answer the query.

I'm providing you with a dictionary where the keys are the entities for you to rank and the values are the node types of those entities to help you determine the ranking.
Your response should only contain the keys of this dictionary.

{ENTS}

Rank the list above with each key on a newline. Then in a separate paragraph, explain your reasoning.

Your output should look like:
```
choice1
choice2
choice3
.
.
.

I ranked dcid1 first because....
```
(Don't include the backticks (`) in your response, those are to show you where the expected response starts and stops.)

If none of the entities make sense to start a graph traversal from to answer the query or if there is a significant mismatch between the word and the detected nodeType in the graph, then simply return the word NONE.
In this case your response should look like:
```
NONE
```

TRAVERSAL_PROMPT = '''
We are traversing a knowledge graph to respond to the query "{QUERY}"

We are starting with {START_ENT} which has been matched to entities with the IDs {START_DCIDS} in our graph.

I will provide you with a dictionary where the keys are the IDs above and the values are paths that can be traversed starting from that ID. Each property traversed in the path is represented as (property) and each path should be read as a continuous traversal from left to right.
I will also provide you some descriptions of properties and NodeTypes to help you with your decisions.

You have two tasks: (1) Determine which paths are most relevant to the query so far and (2) whether the paths are sufficient or if we need to continue traversing them to get a complete answer for the query.
Check all paths from each startingId. It's okay if the picked paths only start from one or a subset of the start IDs.

To complete this task, follow the steps:
  1. Determine which paths are most relevant to the query so far.
  2. Are these paths sufficient to provide a complete answer to the query? (If you select yes, we will not be pulling any more additional information from the knowledge graph. To select yes, you must be confident that NO additional data is needed from the paths to fully and completely answer the query.)
  3. If yes, select the paths that pull in the least amount of irrelevant information to answer the query, or in other words the shortest paths. You can cut a path short if only the first N properties are needed to answer the query. The first line of your response will be "DONE" followed by the paths in format specified below.
     If no, select the paths that we should continue searching to get the necessary data. The first line of your response will be "CONTINUE" followed by the paths to continue searching in the format specified below.

  If none of the paths seem relevant to the query, simply respond with "NONE".

Examples:
{{
  'startId1': [
    "(propA) (propB)",
    "(propA) (propC) (propD)",
    "(propD)"
  ]
  'startId2': [
    "(propD) (propE)",
    "(propF) (propG) (propH)",
    "(propG)"
  ]
}}

1. If we needed both paths (propA -> propC) and (propD -> propE), then the output would be:
```
DONE
path1: startId1 (propA) (propC)
path2: startId2 (propD) (propE)

My reasoning for choosing DONE and selecting these paths are...
```
Notice in this example, we were provided with (propA -> propC -> propD) but only (propA -> propC) was necessary to answer the query so we only returned propA and propC in the output path.


2. If we needed to continue searching the path of (propF -> propG -> propH) to sufficiently answer the query, then the output would be:
```
CONTINUE
path2: startId2 (propF) (propG) (propH)

My reasoning for choosing CONTINUE and selecting this path is...
```

Then double check that all selected paths are either an exact match or a prefix of a path from the dictionary. Underneath your paths, let me know if you double checked this and your reasoning behind your selections.

Here are all of the paths we can traverse starting from {START_ENT}:
{LINKS}

Here is more information about each property and NodeType:
