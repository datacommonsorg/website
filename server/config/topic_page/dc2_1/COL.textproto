    description: "When we think of economic development, we may think of new infrastructure or ways the government may better meet its peoples’ needs. But we often don’t see economic development as something that affects our daily lives. In this article, we aim to review economic development and its social impact on a country. How does this country flourish in the midst of endless difficulties and deep social and political transformations? How can economic development help to reduce violence – particularly homicides? And finally, how do civil society organizations compliment economic development and state action? For this, there is no better country to review than Colombia."

    description: "Over the last 50 years, Latin American (LATAM) countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, Perú and Venezuela have steadily strengthened their GDP, except during the COVID 19 pandemic. There appears to be a regional correlation in economic performance of LATAM countries – when one country prospers, other LATAM countries prosper as a result. Similarly, these countries suffered significant declines during the pandemic. After the pandemic, recovery was accelerated dramatically."
