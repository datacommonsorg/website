{#
A macro for inline insertion of svg icons into the templates.
Inline insertion avoids the potential for flashes the of content
that can occur with the font version of Material icons.

Parameters:

  name: icon file name.
  Must match the name of an SVG file (without extension) located in:
    server/templates/resources/icons.
  eg. "progress_activity"

Example usage:

{% from 'macros/icons.html' import inline_svg %}
{{ inline_svg('progress_activity') }}

Adding icons:
  To add a new icon, copy the SVG into /server/templates/resources/icons.
  Although icons are not strictly limited to Material UI icons, these are
  recommended for consistency and cohesiveness. Material icons may be
  downloaded from: https://fonts.google.com/icons

  The SVG must have a height of "1em", no width and a fill of "currentColor"
  to allow styling via CSS.
