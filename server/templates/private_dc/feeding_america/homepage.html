          The NIH recently <a href="#">reported</a> that America's most food
          insecure populations also tend to have a higher risk of cardiovascular
          disease. You wonder how long it might take to identify counties
          suffering from both high food insecurity and high prevalence of heart
          disease? While Feeding America’s Map the Meal Gap provides high
          quality data on food insecure counties in the US, information on the
          prevalence of heart disease is harder to find. You <a href="#">Search</a> and it
          points you to the <a href="#">CDC</a>. After much digging around, you find the data
          and then spend a while downloading, cleaning and joining it with
          Feeding America's information on food insecurity. Oh dear.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          Feeding America Data Commons is here to help!
        </p>

        <p>
          This is an evolving collaboration between <a href="#">Feeding America’s Map the
          Meal Gap Research Study</a> and <a href="#">Data Commons</a>, the world's largest data
          knowledge graph, aiming to help everyone, whoever you are -
          journalist, citizen scientist, student, researcher - to explore food
          security in the United States and its relationship to climate data and
          health indicators through scatter plots, timelines, and maps. The
          Feeding America Map the Meal Gap annual study aims to understand food
          insecurity and food costs at the local level in the United States.
          Data Commons is a free and public resource with over 3 billion
          time-series, across 90,000 variables from 100+ sources about
          demographics, health, climate, crops, emissions and much more. This
          site makes available, in a unified format, Map the Meal Gap data
          merged with public data from Data Commons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oh, and the answer to your question above? It takes a mere minute to
          show all counties in the US with the prevalence of heart disease and
          rates of food insecurity. <a href="#">Check it out</a> and a few more examples below.

        </span>
    While there are
    significant urban populations in California with food insecurity challenges
    today e.g. Los Angeles County, when food insecurity numbers are mapped with
    anticipated temperature rises, the people of Kern County, the heart of
    California’s agricultural ecosystem that serves the world, will likely
    experience the greatest strife in the years to come.

        </span>
      Combining datasets from the CDC and Map the Meal gap, the
      correlation between heart health and food insecurity is clear. With Data
      Commons, it is possible for any food bank or pantry on the ground to
      explore these correlations and other health conditions in their city
      and county without a significant investment of technical resources,
      and months of research.
