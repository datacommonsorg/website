          The NIH recently <a href="#">reported</a> that America's most food insecure
          populations also tend to have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
          You wonder how long it might take to identify counties suffering from
          both high food insecurity <i>and</i> high prevalence of heart disease? Turns
          out, it could be a while. While Feeding America’s <a href="#">Map the Meal Gap</a>
          provides high quality data on food insecure counties in the US,
          information on the prevalence of heart disease is harder to find. You
          Search and it points you to the <a href="#">CDC</a>. After much digging around, you
          find the data and then spend a while downloading, cleaning and joining
          it with Feeding America's information on food insecurity. You may have
          given up well before you could answer the question.
        </p>

          <p>
Feeding America Data Commons is here to help! It is an evolving collaboration
between Feeding America’s <a href="#">Map the Meal Gap Research Study</a> and <a href="#">Data Commons</a>, the
world's largest data knowledge graph, aiming to help everyone, whoever you are -
journalist, citizen scientist, student, researcher - to explore food security in
the United States and its relationship to climate data and health indicators
through scatter plots, timelines, and maps.
        </p>

          <p>
The Feeding America Map the Meal Gap annual study aims to understand food
insecurity and food costs at the local level in the United States. Data Commons
is a free and public resource with over 3 billion time-series, across 90,000
variables from 100+ sources about demographics, health, climate, crops,
emissions and much more. This site makes available, in a unified format, Map the
Meal Gap data merged with public data from Data Commons.
        </p>

          <p>
Oh, and the answer to your question above? It takes a mere minute to show all
counties in the US with the prevalence of heart disease and rates of food
insecurity. Check it out below.

    While there are
    significant urban populations in California with food insecurity challenges
    today e.g. Los Angeles County, when food insecurity numbers are mapped with
    anticipated temperature rises, the people of Kern County, the heart of
    California’s agricultural ecosystem that serves the world, will likely
    experience the greatest strife in the years to come.

        </span>
      Combining datasets from the CDC and Map the Meal gap, the
      correlation between heart health and food insecurity is clear. With Data
      Commons, it is possible for any food bank or pantry on the ground to
      explore these correlations and other health conditions in their city
      and county without a significant investment of technical resources,
      and months of research.

        </span>
      Combining data from the US Census and Map the Meal gap, one can easily
      (visually and analytically) identify the parts of the US that are not only
      the most food insecure, but also have large segments of population with
      low household income (less than $25,000/year) and have no health
      insurance. It is clear that large parts of middle-America are suffering
      from these multitude of problems, one often exacerbating the other. Note
      also that we can view the same information without normalizing over the
      total county population to see the raw counts of food insecure residents
      and those making less than $25,000/year while having no health insurance.
      Los Angeles County, with its large total population, stands out
      immediately because it has large numbers of people meeting this
      unfortunate criteria.
