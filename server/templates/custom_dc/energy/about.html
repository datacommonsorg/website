  <h1>About the Energy Data Commons</h1>
  <p>The Energy Data Commons brings together key energy and emissions statistics from trusted public sources into one place. The goal is to make it easier to explore consumption, production, the transition to renewables, and related emissions across places and over time.</p>

  <h2>What You Can Do Here</h2>
  <p>You can browse and compare indicators such as electricity generation by source, fossil and renewable shares, per capita consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Visualizations and tables help you see trends by geography and year, and you can download data for analysis, reporting, or modeling.</p>

  <h2>Data &amp; Transparency</h2>
  <p>We rely on official and internationally comparable datasets from national energy agencies and bodies such as the IEA and EIA. Each statistic is linked to its source where possible, so you can verify definitions and methods. We normalize and present data for consistent comparison without altering the underlying values.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>We aim to make energy and emissions data more accessible and usable for policymakers, researchers, educators, and the public, so that data-driven decisions can support a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.</p>
