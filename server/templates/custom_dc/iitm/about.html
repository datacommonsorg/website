  <h1>About India Data Commons</h1>
  <div style="padding: 2rem;">
    <h2>Why India Data Commons</h2>
    <p>
      India Data Commons is an effort by <a href="https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/" target="_blank">Robert Bosch Center 
        for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, IIT Madras</a> 
      to highlight India-specific data in Data Commons knowledge graph. India Data Commons features datasets published by Indian Ministries
      and governmental organizations and provides it through DC knowledge Graph. India Data Commons is powered by
      <a href="https://datacommons.org" target="_blank">Data Commons</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data Commons synthesizes a single graph from
      different data sources. It links references to the same entities
      (such
      as cities, districts, states, etc.) across different datasets to
      nodes
      on the graph, so that users can access data about a particular entity
      aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. We
      hope the data
      contained within Data Commons will be useful to students, researchers, and
      enthusiasts across different disciplines.
