  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions </h1>

  <p>
    <b>Q: What is Data Commons?</b><br>
    Please see <a href="https://datacommons.org/about" target="_blank">About Data Commons</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: What is the purpose of India Data Commons?</b><br>
    India Data Commons is an effort to highlight the India-specific data in the ever-growing Data Commons
    knowledge graph. Indian data incites a lot of interesting insights and questions, and India Data
    Commons features those insights in an user-friendly way. More about India Data Commons on our
    <a href="/about">About page</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: What is the difference between Data Commons and public dataset projects like Dataverse,
      Kaggle datasets, Google Big Query Public Datasets, Dataset search etc.?</b><br>
    These collections of datasets provide a great service by aggregating topical
    open data sets. However though the data is open, using it to answer specific
    questions often involves tedious 'foraging' --- finding the data, cleaning the
    data, reconciling different formats and schemas, figuring out how to merge data
    about the same entity from different sources, etc. This error prone and tedious
    process is repeated, once (or more) by each organization. This is a problem in
    almost every area of study involving data, from the social sciences and physical
    sciences to public policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data Commons is an attempt to ameliorate some of this tedium by doing this
    once,
    on a large scale and providing cloud accessible APIs to the cleaned,
    normalized
    and joined data. While there are millions of datasets and it will be a while
    before Data Commons includes a substantial fraction of them, in every domain,
    some collections of data get used more frequently than others. We have started
    with a core set of these in the hope that useful applications can be built on
    top of them.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Q: What is the difference between Data Commons and
  Wikidata?</b><br>
  The focus in Data Commons is on aggregating external, already available data (with an emphasis on statistical data) from government agencies and other authoritative sources, as opposed to creating a corpus of structured data from scratch.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: What is the relation between DataCommons.org and Schema.org?</b><br>
    DataCommons.org builds upon on the vocabularies defined by Schema.org,
    with additional terms defined to cover concepts (e.g. "citizenship") that are important to the
    data in Data Commons but which have not been a priority
    for Schema.org-based Web markup. The Data Commons schemas constitute an "external extension" to
    Schema.org, similar to that provided by GS1.
    Some schemas could migrate into Schema.org if the community find value in them.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: What are the usage rights of the data in Data Commons?</b><br>
    Data Commons knowledge graph, and the compilation of the datasets is licensed under <a
      href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a>.
    The Data Commons REST API and the R, Python Libraries are released under <a
      href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License 2.0</a>.
    The data included in Data Commons Graph come from different sources. The source of the
    data (provenance) is provided for all the data.
    Provenance includes the URL of the source of the data. While effort is made to obtain data from
    sources which offer unrestricted usage of underlying data, terms of use of this data may be
    subject to different licenses and terms of use as specified in the URL of the provenance.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: How can we access data in Data Commons?</b><br>
    The data in knowledge graph can be accessed through the <a
      href="{{ url_for('browser.browser_main') }}">India Data Commons Graph Browser </a> and APIs for <a
      href="https://docs.datacommons.org/api/python" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a
      href="https://docs.datacommons.org/api/rest" target="_blank">REST</a> and <a
      href="https://docs.datacommons.org/api/sheets" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: How can we add our own data to knowledge graph?</b><br>
    Data Commons is intended to be a community project and seeks your involvement.
    To know more about publishing data that can be included into India Data Commons, check out our 
    <a href="https://docs.datacommons.org/contributing/" target="_blank">documentation</a> section. You can also contact 
    <a href="mailto:datacommons@rbcdsai.org">datacommons@rbcdsai.org </a>
    if you have an interesting dataset that you think should be included in India Data Commons and would
    like to help.
    In the future we plan to allow users to ingest data into the Data Commons Graph using
    an upload tool. We will update the community when this functionality is released.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a name="perCapita">
      <b>Q: What does <em>per capita</em> mean in the Time Series tool?</b>
    </a>
    <br>
    Different variables are measured over different populations. For example,
    the number of people with gender equal male (in a given place) is
    measured over the population of all people. On the other hand, the number
    of people whose educational attainment is High School is measured over
    the set of people whose age is 25 years or higher. Depending on the
    variable, the per capita calculations are done over the population over
    which the measurement was done.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: How long will you store the data for?</b><br>
    Data Commons is not an archival service. We collect the data, build the knowledge graph and
    provide access to the Graph.
    As with any website, long term storage and safekeeping of the data is the responsibility of the
    primary publisher.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: Where can I download all the data?</b><br>
    Given the size and evolving nature of the Data Commons Graph, we prefer you access
    it via the APIs.
    If your project needs local access to a large fraction of the Data Commons Graph, please contact 
    <a href="mailto:datacommons@rbcdsai.org">datacommons@rbcdsai.org </a>
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: How much does this service cost to use?</b><br>
    The public data in the Data Commons Graph is hosted on Google Cloud platform by
    Data Commons and is made available for users. There is no cost for data itself, when it is
    publicly available for free.
    The usage limits for the service beyond free tier quota will be in line with pricing of <a
      href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data">Big Query Public dataset
    program</a>.
    In the future when more data is added to the knowledge graph by users - just like the Web, we
    expect some data to be free, some data to be private, and some data may have an associated cost
    to access.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: How do we know if the data is accurate?</b><br>
    Data Commons provides an access mechanism to data and makes no
    commitment on the accuracy of the data.
    Answers to queries will include the provenance (source of the data). Choice of which data to
    use, based on source, is in developer's control. There may be
    errors in cleaning, etc. of the data. If you find something you
    think is in error, we would love to <a href=feedback>hear</a> from you.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: How often is the data refreshed?</b><br>
    Different data sources refresh at different frequencies. We try to keep the
    data updated as the sources publish new versions of their data.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: What are the SLAs / Performance levels we can expect?</b><br>
    The service is provided on an as-is basis with no SLA or commitments on
    availability or
    uptime.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q: How do I cite datacommons.org?</b><br>
    To cite charts and tools on this site, please use the following format.
  </p>

    <blockquote>
    Data Commons {{ current_year }}, <i>Data Commons</i>, viewed {{ current_date }}, &#60;https://datacommons.org&#62;.
    </blockquote>

  <p>
    If citing data from a particular dataset, e.g. CDC Places, then use:
  </p>

    <blockquote>
    Data Commons {{ current_year }}, CDC Places, electronic dataset, <i>Data Commons</i>, viewed {{ current_date }}, &#60;https://datacommons.org&#62;.
    </blockquote>
  <p>
    In both cases, please use the date you viewed the site (in the examples above, we used {{ current_date }}).
  </p>
