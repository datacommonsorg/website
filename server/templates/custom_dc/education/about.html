  <h1>About the Education Data Commons</h1>
  <p>The Education Data Commons brings together key education statistics from trusted public sources so you can explore enrollment, attainment, spending, and equity across places and time. The goal is to make it easier for educators, researchers, and policymakers to understand and improve education outcomes.</p>

  <h2>What You Can Do Here</h2>
  <p>You can browse and compare indicators such as enrollment rates by level, completion and attainment, expenditure per student, teacher ratios, and literacy. Visualizations and tables let you see trends by geography and year, and you can download data for reports, research, or planning.</p>

  <h2>Data &amp; Transparency</h2>
  <p>We use official and internationally comparable datasets from national education agencies and organizations like UNESCO and OECD. Each statistic is tied to its source where possible, so you can verify definitions and methods. We normalize and present data for consistent comparison without changing the underlying values.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>We aim to make education data more accessible and usable so that evidence can support better policies, resource allocation, and learning outcomes for all.</p>
