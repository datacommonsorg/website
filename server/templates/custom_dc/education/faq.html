  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
  <dl>
    <dt>Q: Where does the education data come from?</dt>
    <dd>Education statistics are drawn from official sources such as national education ministries, UNESCO, OECD, and census or survey programs. Data Commons aggregates and standardizes these so you can compare enrollment, attainment, spending, and other indicators across places and years.</dd>

    <dt>Q: What levels of education are covered?</dt>
    <dd>Coverage varies by dataset, but typically includes early childhood, primary, secondary, and tertiary (higher) education, as well as adult literacy and out-of-school rates. Indicator descriptions and filters in the tool specify the level and definition used.</dd>

    <dt>Q: How do I interpret enrollment vs. attainment?</dt>
    <dd>Enrollment refers to current participation in a given level (e.g., primary school). Attainment refers to completed levels (e.g., percentage of adults with secondary education). Both are useful for understanding access and outcomes in education.</dd>

    <dt>Q: How can I compare schools or districts?</dt>
    <dd>Select the education topic and indicator, then choose the places you want to compare (countries, states, or districts, depending on what's available). The tool shows time series and comparisons so you can see how performance and access differ.</dd>

    <dt>Q: Can I use this data for reports or research?</dt>
    <dd>Yes. The data is intended for analysis and reporting. Use the download or export option to get CSV or other formats. For formal research, we recommend checking the original source documentation for exact definitions and methodology.</dd>

    <dt>Q: Why are some grades or years missing?</dt>
    <dd>Not every jurisdiction reports every indicator every year. Gaps may reflect different reporting cycles, survey design, or data not yet released. The tool shows available data only and does not fill in missing values with estimates.</dd>
