    <h2>Why Data Commons</h2>
        <p>
          The NIH recently <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8000689/">reported</a> that America's most food insecure
          populations also tend to have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
          You wonder how long it might take to identify counties suffering from
          both high food insecurity <i>and</i> high prevalence of heart disease? Turns
          out, it could be a while. While Feeding America’s <a href="https://map.feedingamerica.org/">Map the Meal Gap</a>
          provides high quality data on food insecure counties in the US,
          information on the prevalence of heart disease is harder to find. You
          Search and it points you to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a>. After much digging around, you
          find the data and then spend a while downloading, cleaning and joining
          it with Feeding America's information on food insecurity. You may have
          given up well before you could answer the question.
        </p>

          <p>
Feeding America Data Commons is here to help! It is an evolving collaboration
between Feeding America’s <a href="https://map.feedingamerica.org/">Map the Meal Gap Research Study</a> and <a href="https://datacommons.org">Data Commons</a>, the
world's largest data knowledge graph, aiming to help everyone, whoever you are -
journalist, citizen scientist, student, researcher - to explore food security in
the United States and its relationship to climate data and health indicators
through scatter plots, timelines, and maps.
        </p>

          <p>
The Feeding America Map the Meal Gap annual study aims to understand food
insecurity and food costs at the local level in the United States. Data Commons
is a free and public resource with over 3 billion time-series, across 90,000
variables from 100+ sources about demographics, health, climate, crops,
emissions and much more. This site makes available, in a unified format, Map the
Meal Gap data merged with public data from Data Commons.
        </p>

          <p>
Oh, and the answer to your question above? It takes a mere minute to show all
counties in the US with the prevalence of heart disease and rates of food
insecurity (<a href="/tools/scatter#%26svx%3DDifferenceRelativeToBaseDate2006_Max_Temperature_RCP45%26dx%3DCount_Person%26svy%3DPercent_Person_WithCoronaryHeartDisease%26dy%3DCount_Person%26epd%3Dcountry%2FUSA%26ept%3DCounty%26lb%3D10000%26dd%3D1">see the chart</a>).

    <h2>Who can use it?</h2>
    <p>
      Data Commons can be accessed by anyone via the tools available on
      <a href="https://datacommons.feedingamerica.org">datacommons.feedingamerica.org</a>.

    <h2>Collaborations</h2>
    <p>
      Data Commons has benefited greatly from many collaborations. In
      addition to help from US Department of Commerce (notably the
      Census Bureau), we have received help from our many academic
      collaborations, including, UC San Francisco, Stanford University,
      UC Berkeley and Harvard.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are looking for more collaborators, both for adding new data to
      Feeding America Data Commons and for building new and interesting applications of Data
      Commons. Contact us if you are interested in working with us.
