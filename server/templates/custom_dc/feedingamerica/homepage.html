    Whoever you are - journalist, citizen scientist, student or researcher - here are a few starter examples to explore food security in the United States and its relationship to climate data and health indicators.

    <h3>Climate change and food insecurity in California</h3>

        </span>
    While there are
    significant urban populations in California with food insecurity challenges
    today e.g. Los Angeles County, when food insecurity numbers are mapped with
    anticipated temperature rises, the people of Kern County, the heart of
    California’s agricultural ecosystem that serves the world, will likely
    experience the greatest strife in the years to come.

    <h3>Cardiac Health and food insecurity across the United States</h3>
    <p>
        <span class="img-card float-md-left" style="width: 312px">
          {% set chart_link='/tools/scatter#%26svx%3DCount_Person_FoodInsecure%26pcx%3D1%26dx%3DCount_Person%26svy%3DPercent_Person_WithCoronaryHeartDisease%26dy%3DCount_Person%26epd%3Dcountry%2FUSA%26ept%3DCounty%26lb%3D10000%26qd%3D1%26dd%3D1' %}

          <small class="caption"><a href="{{ chart_link }}">Heart condition vs. Food insecure for US counties</a> (source: CDC, FA)</small>
        </span>
      Combining datasets from the CDC and Map the Meal gap, the
      correlation between heart health and food insecurity is clear. With Data
      Commons, it is possible for any food bank or pantry on the ground to
      explore these correlations and other health conditions in their city
      and county without a significant investment of technical resources,
      and months of research.

    <h3>Food insecure individuals with low income and no health insurance</h3>
    <p>
        <span class="img-card float-md-right" style="width: 312px">
          {% set chart_link='/tools/scatter#%26svx%3DCount_Person_FoodInsecure%26dx%3DCount_Person%26svy%3Ddc%2Fzf3hfsl3dh74g%26dy%3DCount_Person%26epd%3Dcountry%2FUSA%26ept%3DCounty%26lb%3D1000%26dd%3D1%26ct%3D1' %}

          <small class="caption"><a href="{{ chart_link }}">Population of low income without health insurance vs. Food insecure, for US counties</a> (source: CDC, FA, NASA)</small>
        </span>
        Combining data from the US Census and Map the Meal gap, it is
        immediately apparent that large parts of middle America are struggling
        from these interrelated challenges. Instead of per capita numbers, one
        could also view the actual counts of food insecure residents without
        health insurance and making less than $25,000/year. Los Angeles County
        stands out immediately.
