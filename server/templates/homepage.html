    <H1>
      Welcome to Data Commons
    </H1>

    <p>
      Publicly available data from open sources (census.gov, NOAA, data.gov, etc.)
      are vital resources for students and researchers in a variety of disciplines.
      Unfortunately, processing these datasets is often tedious and cumbersome.
      Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying datasets.
      Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities
      (city, county, etc.) and resolving different types of keys/identifiers.
      This process is time consuming and can increase the likelihood for methodological errors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data Commons attempts to synthesize a single "Open Knowledge Graph" from these
      different data sources. It links references to the same entities (such
      as cities, counties, organizations, etc.) across
      different datasets to nodes on the graph, so that users can access data about a
      particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining.
      Like the Web, Data Commons is
      open - any user can contribute datasets or build applications
      powered by the graph. In the long term, we hope the data contained
      within Data Commons will be useful to students, researchers, and enthusiasts
      across different disciplines.
      Though we've "jump-started" the graph with data from publicly
      available sources (CDC, US Census, FBI, etc.), we encourage you to join and
      contribute.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use the <a href="{{ url_for('browser.kg_main') }}">Data Commons
      Graph Browser</a> to browse the graph. The data can be
      programmatically accessed via <a href="http://docs.datacommons.org/api">APIs</a>.
      For example usage, check out the <a href=" {{ url_for('colab') }}">tutorials</a>.
