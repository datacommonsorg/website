  <h2 id="post-2018-10-02">Building tools to help fact checkers</h2>
  <h3>2018-10-02</h3>

  <p>
    In early 2016, in collaboration with academia and the fact checking community, Google and
    schema.org helped to define a new structured data open standard,
    <a href="https://schema.org/ClaimReview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClaimReview</a>.
    In doing so, tech companies started to highlight high quality fact checking content, starting
    with Google through <a
      href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/labeling-fact-check-articles-google-news/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">fact check tag</a>
    and <a
      href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/fact-check-now-available-google-search-and-news-around-world/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">search rich snippet</a>.
    <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/Webmaster-Blog/September-2017/Bing-adds-Fact-Check-label-in-SERP-to-support-the-ClaimReview-markup"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing</a>,
    <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/increasing-our-efforts-to-fight-false-news/"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>
    and others soon began to do the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    In May 2018, we introduced DataCommons.org, an initiative for the open sharing of data, and
    released the first <a href="https://datacommons.org/factcheck/download" target="_blank"
                          rel="noopener">fact check corpus</a>
    to help academia and practitioners to study misinformation. This sample dataset of fact
    checks came from a small but diverse set of publishers. Still, the release of this open
    dataset led to more interests from researchers around the world to study misinformation. We
    also received requests from academia to update the fact check corpus regularly and allow more
    publishers and non-technical users to add ClaimReview markups.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the effort to continue to bolster high quality information on the Web, today, we are
    pleased to share two new tools by Google, starting in limited beta with the academia and
    journalist communities: <i>Fact Check Explorer</i> and <i>Fact Check Markup Tool</i>.
  </p>

  <p>Both tools can be found on Google's newly created experimental
    <a href="https://g.co/factchecktools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fact Check Tools</a>
    site. To start, the
    <a href="https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fact
      Check Explorer</a>
    (FCE) acts as a search engine for fact checking content and allows users to easily search for
    and find fact checks relevant to a topic of interests. Was a new species of trout
    <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blue-bow-trout-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a>
    in Pennsylvania? Is the WhatsApp <a
        href="https://www.boomlive.in/spam-whatsapp-forward-claims-modi-government-to-distribute-free-cycles-on-aug-15/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumor</a>
    about India’s government distributing free cycles to students true? What topics has a certain
    publisher fact checked? All of this can be found in the tool.
  </p>

  <p>The <a href="https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/markuptool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fact
    Check Markup Tool</a>,
    to complement this, makes it possible for journalists and fact checkers to add
    <a href="https://schema.org/ClaimReview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClaimReview</a>
    markup to their articles without having to code or mess around with their CMS, making the
    whole process easy to use even without coding skills. Here’s how it works: a journalist from
    a publisher copies the URL of an article they want to add the markup to, pastes it into the
    tool, completes the form (e.g. who made the claim? What is the verdict? etc.) and then clicks
    "submit". Once completed, the data will be shared openly on DataCommons.org for any and all
    interested companies to access and programmatically incorporate into their products. Note that
    a journalist can only create markups for pages from their own publishers.
  </p>

    <em>Screenshot of the Fact Check Markup Tool, now in beta.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    These two tools are being made available on limited release to select journalists and
    fact-checking
    organizations. The <a href="https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/" target="_blank"
                          rel="noopener">International Fact Checking Network</a>
    will determine those users, in line with their
    <a href="https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code of
      Principles</a>.
    Over time, access to these tools will be opened more broadly.
  </p>

  <p>In line with our commitment to continued sharing of data, all ClaimReview markup data created
    via the Fact Check Markup Tool will be available via the
    <a href="http://www.datacommons.org/factcheck/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fact
      Check Markup Tool Data Feed</a>
    in <a href="https://schema.org/DataFeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DataFeed</a> format
    and will be updated on a frequent and regular basis. We are also releasing an updated version
    of the research Fact Check Corpus. Again, the meta-data in both datasets follows the open
    schema.org standard (<a href="https://schema.org/ClaimReview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClaimReview</a>)
    that has been adopted by most fact checking organizations and is currently being used by
    Google News, Google Search, Bing News, Bing Search, Facebook and others. And the field "url"
    points to the original fact-checking articles, whose content are not part of the released
    datasets and reside on the publishers' sites.
  </p>

  <p>We would like to thank all the contributors for this launch and especially call out
    International Fact-Checking Network and Duke Reporters' Lab for their continued partnership.
  </p>

  <p><i>
    ClaimReview was developed three years ago through a partnership of the
    <a href="https://reporterslab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duke University Reporters’
      Lab</a>, Google, and schema.org. A pioneer of the digital fact-check movement, Duke’s Bill
    Adair is also announcing today, with the help of a grant from the Google News Initiative, a
    new global effort to help journalists and fact checkers adopt ClaimReview in their fact check
    operations. Read more about the effort

    Academia, Publishers and Tech Come Together to Open Up Fact Check Data
  </h2>
  <h3>2018-05-02</h3>

  <p>The Internet began as an academic venture, intended to foster greater
    exchanges between members of different research communities. Since its
    inception, many of its major advancements have come from the academic
    world.</p>

  <p>Today as the Internet and the web play an increasingly important role
    in our everyday lives, we all benefit from that work. This growth has not
    been unchallenged, and the Internet has faced threats including DNS
    spoofing, browser malware, and spam. In every one of these cases, academia
    and industry have joined forces to address these attacks.</p>

  <p>Today, the attack is in the form of misinformation. The Internet has
    empowered individuals to communicate and publish like never before.
    Malicious actors seek to exploit this and undermine the systems we have
    built.</p>

  <p>We wish to attract the energies of academics to fight this new
    threat. Achieving this first requires a better understanding of the
    phenomenon. This of course, is best facilitated through the sharing of
    data. Today we launch DataCommons.org, a schema.org-like initiative for
    the open sharing of data. We start with a dataset aimed at helping us
    understand the characteristics of misinformation.</p>

  <p>
    Fact checks offer a significant lens into the world of misinformation. In
    this release we are providing the metadata associated with a sample of
    fact checks from a number of different sources. The meta-data follows the
    open schema.org standard (<a href="http://schema.org/ClaimReview">ClaimReview</a>)
    that has already been adopted by most fact checking organizations and is
    currently being used by Google News, Google Search, Bing News, Bing
    Search, and others.</p>

  <p>
    This release is a small step towards making it easier for researchers
    around the world to study misinformation and publish findings on a
    publicly available data set. In the future, we are committed to continued
    sharing of data related to the study of misinformation through
    DataCommons.org and within the bounds of privacy constraints. This effort
    is a partnership between the fact checking community (International
    Fact-Checking Network), academic institutions (Carnegie Mellon
    University, Duke University), and industry (Bing, Google).
