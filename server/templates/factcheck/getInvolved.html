      Data Commons is intended to be a community project and seeks your involvement.
      Here are some ways you can help.
    </p>
    <br>
    <li> Publish data that can be included into Data Commons:
      <br>
    </li>
      <ul>
        <li> If you already have web pages that have the data in a human readable form,
          <a href='https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data'>add schema.org markup</a>
          to your page, that expresses the data you would like to publish. In addition to the terms in
          <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a>, you can also use the terms at
          <a href="https://schema.datacommons.org">schema.datacommons.org</a>.
          To ensure that usage rights of the data is clear, make sure to use sdLicense
          on the page, to specify the license associated with data on the page.
        </li>
        <li> Even if you don't already have web pages targeted at humans, you can publish the data using
          one of the formats listed <a href='https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data'>here</a>,
          using schemas from <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a> and/or
          <a href="https://schema.datacommons.org">schema.datacommons.org</a>.
        </li>
        <li> If you have a large dataset that might be of general interest and require help,
          please contact us. We might be able to help. We are in the process of building tools
          to help with conversion of large CSV files, etc. into formats that Data Commons
          can directly ingest.
        </li>
        <li> Please get in touch with us if <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a> and
          <a href="https://schema.datacommons.org">schema.datacommons.org</a> don't have the schemas
          you need for your data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li> We need tools for visualization, summarization, answering queries, etc. Any help
        would be appreciated.
      </li>

      <li> If you encounter issues using Data Commons, please get in touch with us!
         Please write to <a href="mailto:support@datacommons.org">support@datacommons.org</a>.
      </li>
