  <h2 id="post-2019-03-25"> New Source of ClaimReview Markup for Data Commons Feed</h2>
  <h3>2019-03-25</h3>

  <p>
    This month, we launched the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/fact-check/tools/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClaimReview Read/Write API</a>.
    Continuing our commitment to continued sharing of data, markup created via this new API will now
    also be available to Data Commons, joining all ClaimReview markup
    <a href="/factcheck/download#fcmt-data">data</a> created via the
    <a href="https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/markuptool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fact Check Markup Tool</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It will continue to be the case that all data will be in
    <a href="http://schema.org/DataFeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DataFeed</a>
    format and will be updated on a frequent and regular basis. As noted in our
    <a href="/factcheck/blog#post-2018-10-02">October 2018 post</a>,
    the meta-data in both datasets follows the open schema.org standard
    (<a href="http://schema.org/ClaimReview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClaimReview</a>)
    that has been adopted by most fact checking organizations and is currently being used by Google
    News, Google Search, Bing News, Bing Search, Facebook and others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you to all the contributors and especially
    <a href="http://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Fact-Checking Network</a> and
    <a href="https://reporterslab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duke Reporters' Lab</a>
    for their continued partnership.
