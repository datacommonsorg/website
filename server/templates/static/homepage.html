    <p>Data commons cover many topics, from Demographics and Economics to
    Emissions and the Climate. Here are some of our favorite data excursions …
    some alarming, some sad, but always illuminating</p>

      <h3>Climate change</h3>
      <p class="clearfix">
        <span class="img-card float-right" style="width: 300px">
          <span>

          <small class="caption">Max projected summer temperatures for US counties (RCP 4.5) (source: NASA)</small>
        </span>
        Climate change is not just about reducing carbon emissions. It is also
        about adaptation to the change that is already happening. The change in
        temperature is not as simple as 1.5 vs 2 vs 2.5 degrees centigrade.
        These are global averages. At every one of those levels, there will be
        places that become much hotter and places that become colder.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Explore what temperatures in the US might be in 2050 (<a href="#">optimistic</a>,
        <a href="#">pessimistic</a>), in Europe (<a href="#">optimistic</a>, <a href="#">pessimistic</a>). See the
        progression in Europe over time (<a href="#">2040</a>, <a href="#">2045</a>, <a href="#">2050</a>).

        … counties like <a href="#">Todd county</a> and <a href="#">Olgala
        county</a> with high incidence of coronary disease can also expect some
        of the highest the highest temperature rises.

      <h3>Emissions</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="img-card float-right" style="width: 300px">
          <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/images/home-us_emissions.png" />
          <small class="caption">Annual non-biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from large facilities across US states (source: EPA)</small>
        </span>
        Emissions are responsible for the climate crisis. If we look at <a
        href="#">large industrial emissions</a>, we see that Texas is the
        highest emitter, at almost four times more than the next. In fact Texas
        emits as much as <a href="#">Turkey and the UK</a> combined. In Texas,
        we see that  <a href="#">Harris County</a>, which has one of the highest
        concentrations of <a href="#">petrochemical refineries</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Emissions are responsible not just for climate change, but are also
        correlated with a range of health conditions -- from <a href="#">cardiac conditions</a>
        and <a href="#">hypertension</a> to <a href="#">mental unhealthiness</a>. If we look at <a href="#">lifetime
        cancer risks</a> across different counties, we find <a href="#">St John Parish, LA</a> to
        be one of the most dangerous counties from a cancer perspective.
      </p>

          <small class="caption">Annual biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from large facilities across US states (source: EPA)</small>
        </span>
        Biogenic emissions, i.e., emissions from biological sources, are also a
        big contributor to climate change. Interestingly, <a href="#">Florida</a> and <a href="#">Georgia</a>
        are the biggest emitters of <a href="#">biogenic greenhouse gases</a>, thanks to the
        sugar and paper mills. Florida is also the biggest producer of industrial
        Nitrous Oxide, thanks to the production of industrial chemicals in
        Escambia County. This is followed closely by Ascension Parish in
        Louisiana. These two counties produce more NO<sub>2</sub> than most other states!

      <h3>Water</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="img-card float-right" style="width: 300px">

          <small class="caption">Water withdrawal trends in California (source: USGS)</small>
        </span>
        Scarcity of water, for crops, animals and humans, could well be one of
        the things most at risk from climate change. <a href="#">California and
        the Southwest</a> are some of the biggest consumers of water. However,
        we can see that utilization is improving. <a href="#">California</a> in
        particular, has seen irrigation water consumption go down, while
        increasing <a href="#">agriculture</a> yields. Household water
        consumption has stayed flat over the last 30+ years, while <a
        href="#">population</a> has gone up substantially.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, digging deeper, we find that in <a href="#">Imperial County,
        CA</a> (the <a href="#">third highest county</a> in terms of water
        consumption), though overall water consumption, including surface water
        use, has gone down, the use of groundwater has risen sharply.
      </p>

          <small class="caption">Water withdrawal for irrigation vs. projected temperature rise in California (source: USGS, NASA)</small>
        </span>
        Which are the places that might be most impacted by temperature
        changes? While a temperature rise does not immediately imply it, <a
        href="#">this bivariate map</a> shows the places that use the most water for
        irrigation, correlated with the places that might have the highest
        temperature increases.

      <h3>Covid-19</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="img-card float-right" style="width: 300px">
          <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/images/home-covid_uninsured.png" />
          <small class="caption">Positive Covid-19 cases vs. Percentage uninsured across US counties (source: US Census, New York Times)</small>
        </span>
        As many insightful articles from the New York Times and others pointed
        out, Covid-19 affected African American communities much more.
        Unfortunately, Covid-19 prevalence is correlated with many other
        indicators. For example, we see that Covid-19 infection rates are highly
        correlated with the fraction of the population that is <a
        href="#">uninsured</a>, with the fraction of the population that is <a
        href="#">below the poverty line</a>, the fraction of the population on
        <a href="#">food stamps</a>, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, these are just correlations. This <a href="#">colab
        notebook</a> digs deeper, performing a causal analysis to discover the
        most variables most causally predictive of Covid-19 occurrence and
        morbidity.
      </p>

      <h3>Income and other inequalities</h3>
      <p>
        Studies from <a href="#">CDC</a> and others have shown a correlation
        between obesity and poverty. In this <a href="#">colab</a> notebook, we
        explore the relation between poverty, unemployment and obesity.
        Unfortunately, many other medical conditions are inversely correlated
        with economic well being. Explore the relation between <a
        href="#">diabetes and median income</a>, <a href="#">coronary disease
        and income</a>, <a href="#">coronary disease and gdp</a> of counties
        across the US.
