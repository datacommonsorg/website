        The UCSC Genome Browser originated from The Human Genome Project in 2000 to share and visualize genome data.
        It
        has
        grown to include an agglomeration of various genome assemblies and annotations. Data Commons includes data
        annotating
        chromosomes, genes, RNA transcripts, and genetic variants from the UCSC Genome Browser. The .chrom.sizes.txt
        files
        were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser Downloads page on August 13, 2019. The NCBI RefSeq files were
        downloaded
        from the UCSC Table Browser on August 2, 2019 for the following genome assemblies:
