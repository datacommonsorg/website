        Sider is a database of adverse drug reactions curated by the EMBL collaboration. "SIDER contains information on
        marketed medicines and their recorded adverse drug reactions. The information is extracted from public documents
        and
        package inserts. The available information include side effect frequency, drug and side effect classifications
        as
        well
        as links to further information, for example drug–target relations." Data Commons hosts version 4.1 of SIDER

          Annotations</a></h3>
      <p>
        The UCSC Genome Browser originated from The Human Genome Project in 2000 to share and visualize genome data. It
        has
        grown to include an agglomeration of various genome assemblies and annotations. Data Commons includes data
        annotating
        chromosomes, genes, RNA transcripts, and genetic variants from the UCSC Genome Browser. The .chrom.sizes.txt
        files
        were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser Downloads page on August 13, 2019. The NCBI RefSeq files were
        downloaded
        from the UCSC Table Browser on August 2, 2019 for the following genome assemblies:
      </p>

      <p>
        The All SNPs files were downloaded from the UCSC Table Browser on August 13, 2019 for the following genome
        assemblies and dbSNP builds:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>gaGal5 (dbSNP Build 147)</li>
        <li>hg19 (dbSNP Build 151)</li>
