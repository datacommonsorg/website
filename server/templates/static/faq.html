  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
  <dl>
    <dt>Q: What is Data Commons?
    <dd>Data Commons, an open source initiative from Google, organizes the
      world’s publicly available information and makes it more accessible and
      useful. Learn more on <a href="{{ url_for('static.about') }}">About Data
      Commons</a>.

    <dt>Q: Who can use Data Commons?
    <dd>Data Commons is available for anyone to use. Our goal is to make the
      world’s publicly available data more helpful to people and organizations
      working on the big societal challenges like climate change, food security,
      or economic inequity.

    <dt>Q: Is Data Commons free or is there a cost to use it?
    <dd>There is no cost for the publicly available data, which is hosted on
      Google Cloud by Data Commons. For individuals or organizations who exceed
      the free usage limits, pricing will be in line with the <a
      href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data">BigQuery public dataset
      program</a>.

    <dt>Q: What is the new Explore interface to Data Commons?
    <dd>Data Commons has a new Explore interface that uses large language models
      (LLMs) to map your natural language question to the public data sets to
      extract the right visualizations to your question. We do not use LLMs to
      generate any data or visualizations; all responses are based on real data
      with sourced provenance from Data Commons.

    <dt>Q: How do you choose which dataset to show in the Explore interface?
    <dd>The LLMs powering Data Commons’ Explore interface use generative AI to
      identify the most likely response to your query. As we continue to improve
      the interface, we will look to provide more options that allow the user to
      select sources themselves.

    <dt>Q: Is my data suitable to the base Data Commons </dt>

    <dt>Q: How do I suggest data I think should be added to Data Commons?
    <dd>Yes, Data Commons is meant to be for the community, by the community and
      we welcome new submissions or suggestions. If you are interested in importing your data to Data Commons, 
      please file a <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=1660823&template=2053232" target="_blank">data request</a> in our issue tracker.
    <dt>Q: Where can I download all the data?
    <dd>Given the size and evolving nature of the Data Commons knowledge graph,
      you cannot download _all_ the data. You can download all the data pertaining to a specific subset of metrics (variables).
      You can use the <a href="https://datacommons.org/tools/download">Data Download Tool</a> to download CSV files, or you can use the
      <a href="docs.datacommons.org/api/ target="_blank">APIs</a> to programmatically retrieve data in JSON format.

    <dt>Q: How do we know if the data is accurate?
    <dd>Data Commons provides an access mechanism to data, but cannot ensure
      accuracy. To provide as much context as possible, answers to queries will
      include the provenance (source of the data). The choice of which data to use
      is up to individuals. If you find something you think is in error, please file a bug </a>.

    <dt>Q: How often is the data refreshed?
    <dd>Different data sources refresh at different frequencies. We try to keep
      the data updated as the sources publish new versions of their data. If you
      see something out of date, please file an <a href="https://github.com/datacommonsorg/data/issues">issue on Github</a>.

    <dt>Q: What are the SLAs / Performance levels we can expect?
    <dd>The service is provided on an as-is basis with no SLA or commitments on availability or uptime.

    <dt>Q: How do I cite datacommons.org?
    <dd>To cite charts and tools on this site, please use the following format.
      <blockquote>
      Data Commons {{ current_year }}, <i>Data Commons</i>, viewed {{ current_date }}, &#60;https://datacommons.org&#62;.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        If citing data from a particular dataset, e.g. CDC Places, then use:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
      Data Commons {{ current_year }}, CDC Places, electronic dataset, <i>Data Commons</i>, viewed {{ current_date }}, &#60;https://datacommons.org&#62;.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In both cases, please use the date you viewed the site (in the examples above, we used {{ current_date }}).
      </p>

    <dt>Q: What is the difference between Data Commons and other other public dataset projects?
    <dd>Many public dataset projects provide a great service by aggregating
      topical open data sets. However, using those data sets to answer specific
      questions often involves 'foraging' — finding the data, cleaning the data,
      reconciling different formats and schemas, figuring out how to merge data
      about the same entity from different sources, etc. This error prone and
      tedious process is repeated, once (or more) by each organization working on
      an issue. This is a challenge in almost every area of study involving data,
      from the social sciences and physical sciences to public policy.  Data
      Commons does this work once, on a large scale, and provides cloud accessible
      APIs to the cleaned, normalized and joined data. While there are millions of
      datasets in every domain, some collections of data get used more frequently
      than others. We have started with a core set of these (over 120) in the hope
      that useful applications can be built on top of them.

    <dt>Q: What is the difference between Data Commons and Wikidata?
    <dd>The focus in Data Commons is on aggregating external, already available
      data (with an emphasis on statistical data) from government agencies and
      other authoritative sources.

    <dt>Q: What is the relation between DataCommons.org and Schema.org?
    <dd>DataCommons.org builds upon the vocabularies defined by Schema.org, with
      additional terms defined to cover concepts (e.g. "citizenship") that are
      important to the data in Data Commons but which have not been a priority for
      Schema.org-based Web markup. The Data Commons schemas constitute an
      "external extension" to Schema.org, similar to that provided by <a
      href="http://blog.schema.org/2016/02/gs1-milestone-first-schemaorg-external.html">GS1</a>.
      Some schemas could migrate into Schema.org if the community finds value in
      them.

    <dt>Q: What are the usage rights of the data in Data Commons?
    <dd>The Data Commons knowledge graph, and the compilation of the datasets is
      licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC
      BY</a>. The Data Commons REST API and the R, Python Libraries are released
      under <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License
      2.0</a>. The data included in Data Commons come from different sources. The
      data provenance is provided for all the data, including a link to the
      source. While we make every effort to obtain data from sources offering
      unrestricted usage of underlying data, terms of use of data may be subject
      to different licenses and terms of use,  specified in linked source of the
      data.

    <dt>Q: Can my educational institution use Data Commons while complying with the Family 
      Educational Rights Privacy Act 
      (<a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>) 
      and/or similar state privacy requirements?
    <dd> Data Commons collects no personal information (PII), records, or private 
      information from users and can be used in compliance with 
      <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>. 
      For specific questions about FERPA compliance, please contact your organization’s 
      legal counsel for advice. 

    <dt>Q: What data do you collect about me?
    <dd>Data Commons uses Google Analytics to collect non-identifiable usage
      data to improve the product. We log all queries asked in the Search tool,
      but do not associate IP address or any other identifiers with the queries.
      We do use in-session cookies to be able to manage state.
