  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
  <dl>
    <dt>Q: What is Data Commons?
    <dd>Data Commons, an open source initiative from Google, organizes the
      world’s publicly available information and makes it more accessible and
      useful. Learn more on <a href="{{ url_for('static.about') }}">About Data
        Commons</a>.

    <dt>Q: Who can use Data Commons?
    <dd>Data Commons is available for anyone to use. Our goal is to make the
      world’s publicly available data more helpful to people and organizations
      working on the big societal challenges like climate change, food security,
      or economic inequity.

    <dt>Q: Is Data Commons free or is there a cost to use it?
    <dd>There is no cost for the publicly available data, which is hosted on
      Google Cloud by Data Commons. For individuals or organizations who exceed
      the free usage limits, pricing will be in line with the <a
        href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data">BigQuery public dataset program</a>.

    <dt>Q: What is the difference between Data Commons and other other public dataset projects?
    <dd>Many public dataset projects provide a great service by aggregating
      topical open data sets. However, using those data sets to answer specific
      questions often involves 'foraging' — finding the data, cleaning the data,
      reconciling different formats and schemas, figuring out how to merge data
      about the same entity from different sources, etc. This error-prone and
      tedious process is repeated, once (or more) by each organization working on an issue. This is a challenge in almost every area of study involving data, from the social sciences and physical sciences to public policy. Data Commons does this work once, on a large scale, and provide cloud-accessible APIs to the cleaned, normalized and joined data. While there are millions of datasets in every domain, some collections of data get used more frequently than others.

    <dt>Q: What is the difference between Data Commons and Wikidata?
    <dd>The focus in Data Commons is on aggregating external, already available
      data (with an emphasis on statistical data) from government agencies and
      other authoritative sources.

    <dt>Q: What is the relation between DataCommons.org and Schema.org?
    <dd>DataCommons.org builds upon the vocabularies defined by Schema.org, with
      additional terms defined to cover concepts (e.g. "citizenship") that are
      important to the data in Data Commons but which have not been a priority for Schema.org-based Web markup. The Data Commons schemas constitute an
      "external extension" to Schema.org, similar to that provided by <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2016/02/gs1-milestone-first-schemaorg-external.html">GS1</a>. Some schemas could migrate into Schema.org if the community finds value in them.

    <dt>Q: What is the new Explore interface to Data Commons?
    <dd>Data Commons has a new Explore interface that uses large language models
      (LLMs) to map your natural-language question to the public data sets to
      extract the right visualizations to your question. We do not use LLMs to
      generate any data or visualizations; all responses are based on real data
      with sourced provenance from Data Commons.

    <dt>Q: How do you choose which dataset to show in the Explore interface?
    <dd>The LLMs powering Data Commons’ Explore interface use generative AI to
      identify the most likely response to your query. As we continue to improve
      the interface, we will look to provide more options that allow users to
      select sources themselves.

    <dt>Q: Is my data suitable for adding to Data Commons?</dt>
    <dd>Data Commons is intended for public, statistical, macro data that benefits from being joined with other macrodata to derive new insights. Your data is a good fit for Data Commons if it meets the following criteria:
      <ul>
        <li>It can be licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons BY</a> (CC BY) agreement.</li>
        <li>It is pre-aggregated up to a minimal level that is common to other datasets; for example, an administrative area (place).</li>
      </ul>
      You can run your own Data Commons instance for data that is private and not appropriate for CC BY licensing. However, micro data, i.e. individual-level data, cannot currently be aggregated by Data Commons. In general, if there is no way to join your data with existing Data Commons datasets, on a common entity such as an administrative area or institution, there isn't much benefit to using Data Commons.
      To determine whether your data is best served by the base Data Commons (Google-run datacommons.org) or by a custom instance that you run yourself, see the <a href="https://docs.datacommons.org/custom_dc/faq.html" target="_blank">Custom Data Commons FAQ</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt>Q: How can I suggest adding my data to Data Commons?
    <dd>Data Commons is meant to be for the community, by the community and
      we welcome new submissions or suggestions. If you are interested in importing your data to Data Commons, please file a <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=1660823&template=2053232"
        target="_blank">data request</a> in our issue tracker.

    <dt>Q: Where can I download all the data?
    <dd>Given the size and evolving nature of the Data Commons knowledge graph,
      you cannot download <em>all</em> the data. You can download all the data pertaining to a specific subset of metrics (variables). You can use the <a href="https://datacommons.org/tools/download">Data Download Tool</a> to
      download CSV files, or you can use the <a href="https://docs.datacommons.org/api/" target="_blank">APIs</a> to programmatically retrieve data in JSON format.

    <dt>Q: How do we know if the data is accurate?
    <dd>Data Commons provides an access mechanism to data, but cannot ensure
      accuracy. To provide as much context as possible, answers to queries will
      include the provenance (source of the data). The choice of which data to use is up to individuals. If you find something you think is in error, please file a <a href="https://b.corp.google.com/issues/new?component=1659535&template=2053231" target="_blank">bug</a> in our
      issue tracker.

    <dt>Q: How often is the data refreshed?
    <dd>Different data sources refresh at different frequencies. We try to keep
      the data updated as the sources publish new versions of their data. If you
      see something out of date, please file a <a href="https://b.corp.google.com/issues/new?component=1659535&template=2053231" target="_blank">bug</a> in our issue tracker.

    <dt>Q: What are the SLAs / performance levels we can expect?
    <dd>The service is provided on an as-is basis with no SLA or commitments on availability or uptime.

    <dt>Q: How do I cite datacommons.org?
    <dd>To cite charts and tools on this site, please use the following format.
      <blockquote>
        Data Commons {{ current_year }}, <i>Data Commons</i>, viewed {{ current_date }},
        &#60;https://datacommons.org&#62;.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        If citing data from a particular dataset, e.g. CDC Places, then use:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Data Commons {{ current_year }}, CDC Places, electronic dataset, <i>Data Commons</i>, viewed {{ current_date }},
        &#60;https://datacommons.org&#62;.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In both cases, please use the date you viewed the site (in the examples above, we used {{ current_date }}).
      </p>

    <dt>Q: What are the usage rights of the data in Data Commons?
    <dd>The Data Commons knowledge graph, and the compilation of the datasets is
