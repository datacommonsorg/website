    <h2>Why Data Commons</h2>
    <p>
      Publicly available data from open sources (census.gov, cdc.gov,
      data.gov, etc.) are vital resources for students and researchers in a
      variety of disciplines. Unfortunately, processing these datasets is
      often tedious and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive
      practices for codifying datasets. Combining data from different sources
      requires mapping common entities (city, county, etc.) and resolving
      different types of keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming,
      tedious and done over and over. Our goal with Data Commons is to
      address this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data Commons synthesizes a single graph from
      these different data sources. It links references to the same entities
      (such
      as cities, counties, organizations, etc.) across different datasets to
      nodes
      on the graph, so that users can access data about a particular entity
      aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. We
      hope the data
      contained within Data Commons will be useful to students, researchers, and
      enthusiasts across different disciplines.
    </p>

    <h2>Who can use it?</h2>
    <p>
      Data Commons can be accessed by anyone via the tools available on
      datacommons.org. Students, researchers and developers can use the
      <a href="https://docs.datacommons.org/api/" target="_blank">REST, Python and Google Sheets APIs</a>, all of which are free for educational,
      academic and journalistic research purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Collaborations</h2>
    <p>
      Data Commons has benefited greatly from many collaborations. In
      addition to help from US Department of Commerce (notably the
      Census Bureau), we have received help from our many academic
      collaborations, including, UC San Francisco, Stanford University,
      UC Berkeley and Harvard.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are looking for more collaborators, both for adding new data to
      Data Commons and for building new and interesting applications of Data
      Commons. Contact us if you are interested in working with us.
