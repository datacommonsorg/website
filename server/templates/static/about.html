    <h2>Why Data Commons</h2>
    <p>
      Many of the big challenges we face — climate change, increasing
      inequities, epidemics of diabetes and other health conditions — will
      need deep insights to solve. These insights will need to be firmly
      grounded in data. Fortunately, a lot of this data is already publicly
      available.  Unfortunately, there is a difference between data being public
      and data being easily usable by those who need access to it. It is this
      gap that we are trying to bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Google has organized and made easily accessible many kinds of information
      — web pages, images, maps, videos and so on. Now we are doing this for
      publicly available data. We have organized the core of this data from a
      wide range of sources, ranging from governmental statistical organizations
      like census bureaus to organizations like the World Bank and the United
      Nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      And recent advances in AI have enabled us to go much farther than we had
      thought possible in making this data easily accessible - now you can use
      natural language to access the data. Still early days, but we are very
      bullish on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data Commons synthesizes a single graph from
      these different data sources. It links references to the same entities
      (such
      as cities, counties, organizations, etc.) across different datasets to
      nodes
      on the graph, so that users can access data about a particular entity
      aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. We
      hope the data
      contained within Data Commons will be useful to students, researchers, and
      enthusiasts across different disciplines.

    <h2>Who can use it?</h2>
    <p>
      Data Commons can be accessed by anyone at <a
      href="https://datacommons.org" target="_blank">Datacommons.org</a>! There
      are tools available for students, researchers, journalists, non profits,
      policymakers, and private enterprises that allow you to manipulate and
      make decisions based on data without the need to know how to code.
      Software developers can use the <a
      href="https://docs.datacommons.org/api/" target="_blank">REST, Python and
      Google Sheets APIs</a>, all of which are free for educational, academic
      and journalistic research purposes.

    <h2>Collaborations</h2>
    <p>
      Data Commons has benefited greatly from many collaborations. In addition
      to help from US Department of Commerce (notably the Census Bureau), we
      have received help from our many academic collaborations, including,
      University of California San Francisco, Stanford University, University of
      California Berkeley, Harvard University and Indian Institute of Technology
      Madras. We have also collaborated with nonprofits such as Techsoup,
      Feeding America, and Resources for the Future.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are looking for more collaborators, both for adding new data to Data
      Commons and for building new and interesting applications of Data Commons.
