    <h1>About Data Commons</h1>
    <p>
      Publicly available data from open sources (census.gov, NOAA, data.gov,
      etc.) are vital resources for students and researchers in a variety of
      disciplines. Unfortunately, processing these datasets is often tedious
      and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying
      datasets. Combining data from different sources requires mapping common
      entities (city, county, etc.) and resolving different types of
      keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming and can increase the
      likelihood for methodological errors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data Commons attempts to synthesize a single "Open Knowledge Graph" from
      these different data sources. It links references to the same entities (such
      as cities, counties, organizations, etc.) across different datasets to nodes
      on the graph, so that users can access data about a particular entity
      aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. Like the
      Web, Data Commons is open - any user can contribute datasets or build
      applications powered by the graph. In the long term, we hope the data
      contained within Data Commons will be useful to students, researchers, and
      enthusiasts across different disciplines. Though we've "jump-started" the
      graph with data from publicly available sources (CDC, US Census, FBI, etc.),
      we encourage you to join and contribute.
    </p>
