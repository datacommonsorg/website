# Data Commons Website

This repo hosts code for the Data Commons website.

## About Data Commons

[Data Commons](https://datacommons.org/) is an open knowledge graph that
provides a unified view across multiple public data sets and statistics. We've
bootstrapped the graph with lots of [data](https://docs.datacommons.org/datasets/)
from US Census, CDC, NOAA, etc., and through collaborations with the New York
Botanical Garden, Opportunity Insights, and more. However, Data Commons is meant
to be for community, by the community. We are excited to work with you to make
public data accessible to everyone.

To see the extent of data we have today, browse the graph using our
[browser](https://datacommons.org/browser).
