"""Generate ranking-based summaries for all child places of a specific place
type in a parent place.

This was the script used to generate the summaries used in mid-January 2024,
which are no longer used. This script is no longer used and has been depreciated
in favor of fetch_place_summaries.py.

Will generate summaries like:
  <place name> is a <place type> in <parent place>. <place_name> ranks <rank>
  in <parent place> by <stat var name> (<value>).

Will only add a sentence about a variable to the summary if the place ranks
highly by that variable.
