# Curated Input for Bio index

This index has properties used by biomedical entities and follows the format of [relation expressions](https://docs.datacommons.org/api/rest/v2#relation-expressions). Properties can be structured like:

- `prop`: this can match to either in or out properties
    - e.g., `virusHost` which will match both the 'in' and 'out' values for the property virusHost
- `->prop`: this matches to an 'out' property
    - e.g., `->phylum` which will match the 'out' values for the property phylum
- `<-prop`: this matches to an 'in' property
    - e.g., `<-virusGenus` which will match the 'in' values for the property virusGenus
- `<-prop1{typeOf:X}->prop2`: in this case, we will get all the 'in' values for prop1 that are of type X & then from those values, get all the 'out' values for prop2
    - e.g., `<-geneID{typeOf:DiseaseGeneAssociation}->diseaseOntologyID` which will first get all the DiseaseGeneAssociations that are 'in' values for the property geneID and then get all the 'out' values for the property diseaseOntologyID for those DiseaseGeneAssociations.
