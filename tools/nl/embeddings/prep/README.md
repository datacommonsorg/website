# Prepare `autogen_input` files

Given a list of SVs, the script `gen_svs.py` prepares files that are to be
added to `autogen_input` directory of the embeddings flow.

To run this, prepare your input file in `input_svs.csv` (note that this is a
header-less file of SV DCIDs, one per line). Then, run:

```
./run.sh
```
