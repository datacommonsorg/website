This script is designed to run Percy snapshots for Data Commons in different environments (staging or production).
It navigates to specified URLs and takes snapshots using Percy.
It uses Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
It is intended to be run in a CI/CD environment, such as Google Cloud Build.
A percy token is required to authenticate the snapshots.

Usage:
    npx percy exec -- python3 per_environment_percy_snapshots.py --env staging
