 * Helper method to check if a feature is enabled with feature flags.

 * Feature flags are set for each environment in

 *
 * Feature flags can be overridden and enabled manually
 * by adding ?enable_feature=<feature_name> to the URL
 * or disabled manually by adding ?disable_feature=<feature_name>
 * to the URL. If both overrides are provided, the feature will be enabled.
 *
 * Example:
 * https://datacommons.org/explore?enable_feature=autocomplete will enable the autocomplete feature.
 * https://datacommons.org/explore?enable_feature=autocomplete&enable_feature=metadata_modal will enable both the autocomplete and metadata_modal features.
 * https://datacommons.org/explore?disable_feature=autocomplete will disable the autocomplete feature.
 *
 * @param featureName name of feature for which we want status.
 * @returns Bool describing if the feature is enabled
