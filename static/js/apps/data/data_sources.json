The model underlying the database can accommodate a range of assembly structures, including sets of unordered contig or scaffold sequences, bacterial genomes consisting of a single complete chromosome, or complex structures such as a human genome with modeled allelic variation. The database provides an assembly accession and version to unambiguously identify the set of sequences that make up a particular version of an assembly, and tracks changes to updated genome assemblies. The Assembly database reports metadata such as assembly names, simple statistical reports of the assembly (number of contigs and scaffolds, contiguity metrics such as contig N50, total sequence length and total gap length) as well as the assembly update history. The Assembly database also tracks the relationship between an assembly submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Consortium (INSDC) and the assembly represented in the NCBI RefSeq project” (Kitts et al. 2016). In this import we include the metadata for all genome assemblies documented in `assembly_summary_genbank.txt` and `assembly_summary_refseq.txt`. Assemblies are stored in GenomeAssembly nodes whose information is integrated from both the GenBank and RefSeq datasets."

These gene identifiers are used throughout NCBI’s databases and tracked through updates of annotation.
