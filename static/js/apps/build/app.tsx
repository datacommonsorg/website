            A custom instance natively joins your data and the base Data Commons
            data (from datacommons.org) in a unified fashion. Your users can
            visualize and analyze the data seamlessly without the need for
            further data preparation.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have full control over your own data and computing resources,
            with the ability to limit access to specific individuals or open it
            to the general public.
