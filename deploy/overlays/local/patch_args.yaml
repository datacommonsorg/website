# Update ESP container startup options to work locally without talking to GCP.
# The local ESP args are quite different comparing with GCP args as it does not
# talk to GCP at all. This
# 1. remove "--service"
# 3. add "--service_json_path" to use json service config
# 4. add a bunch of other local only args
