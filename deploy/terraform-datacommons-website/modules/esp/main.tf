# Needed because file(https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/file)
# cannot be used for dynamically generated files.
# Once https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/pull/6895
# is merged, this can be replaced with google_storage_bucket_object_content so that
# mixer grpc pb can be fetched directly from gcs, as opposed first downloading it locally.
# https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/data-sources/storage_bucket_object_content
#
#
# Currently this is copied over during terraform runtime in install_custom_dc.sh
# This is because terraform apply expects the file to already exist at the path
# specified below.
# When testing locally, copy over the mixer grpc pb manually into the current
# module folder, like below. (Script below assumes you are currently in module folder).
# gsutil cp \
#  gs://datcom-mixer-grpc/mixer-grpc/mixer-grpc.$MIXER_GITHASH.pb \
